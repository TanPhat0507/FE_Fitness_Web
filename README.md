- Ensuring movement of game elements such as ball and paddle is a formidable challenge

- **Interactive Power-ups:** Enhance the gaming experience with a variety of interactive power-ups. These could include speed boosts, multi-ball features, or temporary shields, adding strategic depth to gameplay.

- **Customization Options:** Allow players to customize their gaming experience. This might involve choosing different paddle styles, ball designs, or even background themes to add a personal touch.
- **Sound and Music Enhancements:** Elevate the audio experience with dynamic sound effects and background music that complement the game's pacing and intensity. A well-crafted soundtrack can enhance immersion.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement clear feedback mechanisms to inform players of their progress, achievements, and in-game events. Visual and audio cues can enhance the overall feedback experience.
